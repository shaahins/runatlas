    <h1>Privacy Policy for RunAtlas</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>RunAtlas is a personal running analytics app that helps you visualize and track your running history. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app accesses and how it's used.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <h3>HealthKit Data</h3>
    <p>RunAtlas requests read-only access to your Apple Health workout data, specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Running Workouts</strong>: Distance, duration, date, and GPS route data</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How this data is used:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is processed locally on your device</li>
        <li>Running statistics and visualizations are generated on-device</li>
        <li>Location data is reverse-geocoded (converted to city/country names) using Apple's MapKit services</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What we DO NOT do:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your health data to any external servers</li>
        <li>We do NOT share your data with third parties</li>
        <li>We do NOT use your data for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>iCloud (CloudKit)</h3>
    <p>RunAtlas uses Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) to store user-edited locations for indoor runs. This data is stored in your private iCloud account and syncs across your devices. Only you can access this data — it is not visible to us or anyone else.</p>

    <h3>Location Services</h3>
    <p>The app uses Apple's MapKit to convert GPS coordinates from your runs into city and country names. This is done using Apple's standard geocoding service. No location data is sent to any servers other than Apple's geocoding service.</p>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All processed run data is cached locally on your device for faster app loading</li>
        <li>This cache is stored only on your device and is not accessible to us or any third party</li>
        <li>You can delete this data at any time by deleting the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>RunAtlas uses only Apple's built-in services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HealthKit</strong> — To read your running workout data</li>
        <li><strong>MapKit</strong> — To convert coordinates to location names and display maps</li>
        <li><strong>CloudKit</strong> — To sync indoor run locations across your devices via iCloud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services are used.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any of your data with anyone. Period.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in Settings &gt; Health &gt; Data Access &amp; Devices &gt; RunAtlas</li>
        <li>You can delete all app data by uninstalling the app</li>
        <li>The app works offline once your data is loaded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app simply reads existing HealthKit data that the user has already recorded.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/shaahins/apple-watch-analytics/issues">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

        <strong>Summary</strong>
        RunAtlas reads your running data from Apple Health, processes it entirely on your device, and never sends your personal data anywhere. Indoor run locations sync privately via your iCloud account. Your data stays yours.
